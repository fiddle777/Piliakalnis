			U2
		T1, OOP concepts
	Inheritance
Inheritance chains for events and actions(interface; implemented by base; extended by action)
	Encapsulation
Private fields controlled by public getters and setters
	Polymorphism
Actions and events: gameController knows not what they contain, only calls them
	Abstraction
GameAction & GameEvent
		T2, Clean code
	Class and method length
Done
	DRY
removed clamps from actions and events, now done in Piliakalnis
	Magic numbers
Replaced by private static finals
	KISS
EventManager filled with helpers for example
		T3, Design patterns
	Creational pattern
Factory pattern applied
	Behavioural pattern
GameController+GameAction.execute() -- INVOKERS
Piliakalnis -- RECEIVER
GameAction -- COMMAND
		T4 Unit tests
	Tests cover:
State changes (morale, gold, food, population)
Boundary conditions (caps, minimums)
Event triggering conditions
Regression checks
	Framework
Uses JUnit 5
Tests are deterministic and focused on core logic.
